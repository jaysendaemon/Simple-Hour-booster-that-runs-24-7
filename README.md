# Simple-Hour-booster-that-runs-24-7

To run this: First off all to run this 24/7 we will need a website called replit. This allows us to run it 24/7. Make an account on https://replit.com/~ .  After that make a new repl on this website.  In the left bottom corner of your repl click the git button. Now put the link of this repository in the text box. Now open the secrets tab on the left bottom corner. After you have done that add a new secret and call it password, also do this for your shared secret if you have it. Now run the script. After you have done that go to uptimerobot and also make an account. This will allow to run the script for 24/7 on a server. Add a new monitor and put the link in displayed on the top right corner after you have ran the repl. Now your done!
